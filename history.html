      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">History of Student Veterans of America (SVA)</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Through the ’70s, ’80s, and ’90s, veterans continued to transition to campus following their military service, albeit in smaller numbers. 
        The revised Montgomery G.I. Bill was offered as a recruitment incentive for the all-volunteer force. Some of the local student veteran 
        groups that formed on campuses after conflicts in Korea and Vietnam, like those at Northern Illinois University and the University of 
        Wisconsin-Madison, still exist today.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. launched Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq). 
        As OEF and OIF veterans returned home to use GI Bill benefits, they found that their campuses did not provide adequate support services 
        to assist student veterans as they worked towards their educational goals.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Lacking support, student veterans decided to organize on campuses across the country. These groups began to connect through social media 
        with one another to spread best practices, share success stories, and support one another to further strengthen the student veteran 
        community. In 2008, members from various chapters formalized this grassroots movement and Student Veterans of America was born at the 
        very first NatCon in Chicago.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        SVA was officially incorporated on January 23, 2008 to provide programs, resources, and support to the ever-evolving network of local 
        student veteran organizations. Each of these independent groups joined the umbrella coalition as a chapter.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Concurrently, SVA and a number of Veteran Service Organizations were tirelessly advocating for an overhaul of the G.I. Bill to address 
        the needs of the 21st Century student veteran. Six months after SVA’s founding, President George W. Bush signed the Post 9/11 G.I. Bill 
        into law.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Since SVA’s founding in 2008, over one million veterans have returned home to pursue a postsecondary degree or certificate using VA 
        education benefits. To meet this need, SVA’s presence at the local and national levels has grown to include over 1,500 chapters, numerous 
        private and nonprofit partners, and an expanding list of impactful programs and services for student veterans, military-connected students, 
        survivors, and others. SVA welcomed over 2,500 to its largest ever NatCon on January 3-5, 2020 in Los Angeles.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-4">History of American Military University (AMU)</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In 1991, retired Marine Corps officer James P. Etter founded American Military University and broke new ground by offering career-relevant, 
        distance education for a mobile population of military learners with unique needs. Over the next 10 years, many more undergraduate and 
        graduate programs were added to help prepare students for leadership roles both within the military and for transition to post-military 
        careers.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In 2002, AMU was reorganized into the American Public University System (APUS), and American Public University (APU) was founded to 
        provide the same quality, affordable, and flexible education to a broader audience of motivated working adults.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Today the university system is one of the largest providers of online higher education offering more than 190 academic programs to 
        students enrolled worldwide. The AMU student body is full of ambitious professionals from all fields sharing a common motivation for 
        continuing their education and preparing to reach their career potential.
